# Restaurant API (for lab) 

FastAPI service providing simplified APIs for a fictional restaurant, to be 
used in a workshop/lab on LLM Agents and Guardrails. 

Notes: 
- this contrived example is intentionally kept simple.  
- we also re-use the virtualenv created for the Guardrail lab, even though it includes Python dependencies not required by the Restaurant API, for simplicity (i.e. to avoid participants confusing multiple virtualenvs)
